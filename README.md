# My Python to Machine Learning Learning Journey

This folder documents my step-by-step journey learning Python from the very basics all the way to building my first machine learning model.

## Overview

Starting with "Hello, World!" and progressing through Python fundamentals, data science tools (NumPy and Pandas), and finally machine learning concepts, this collection represents my learning path. Each file focuses on one concept and includes comments that reflect my thinking process as I learned.

## File Structure

### Basic Python (01-12)
- **01_hello_world.py** - My first Python program
- **02_variables_and_types.py** - Understanding variables and data types
- **03_basic_math.py** - Mathematical operations
- **04_strings_and_methods.py** - Working with text and string methods
- **05_lists.py** - Lists and list operations
- **06_tuples.py** - Tuples (immutable lists)
- **07_dictionaries.py** - Key-value pairs and dictionaries
- **08_conditionals.py** - If/else statements and decision making
- **09_loops.py** - For and while loops
- **10_functions.py** - Creating reusable functions
- **11_modules_and_imports.py** - Using Python modules
- **12_file_handling.py** - Reading from and writing to files

### Data Science Tools (13-18)
- **13_intro_to_numpy.py** - Introduction to NumPy
- **14_numpy_arrays.py** - Creating and working with NumPy arrays
- **15_numpy_operations.py** - NumPy mathematical operations
- **16_intro_to_pandas.py** - Introduction to Pandas DataFrames
- **17_pandas_dataframe_basics.py** - Basic DataFrame operations
- **18_pandas_data_cleaning.py** - Cleaning and preparing data

### Machine Learning Introduction (19-24)
- **19_intro_to_ml_concepts.py** - Core ML concepts and terminology
- **20_train_test_split.py** - Splitting data for training and testing
- **21_linear_regression_basics.py** - Understanding linear regression
- **22_training_linear_regression_model.py** - Training my first model
- **23_model_prediction.py** - Making predictions with a trained model
- **24_model_evaluation_metrics.py** - Evaluating model performance (MSE, R²)

### Final Project (25)
- **25_house_price_prediction.py** - Complete ML project: predicting house prices using the Boston Housing dataset

## How to Use

1. Start with `01_hello_world.py` and work through the files in numerical order
2. Each file is self-contained and can be run independently
3. Read the comments - they explain what I was learning and thinking
4. Try modifying the code to experiment and reinforce learning

## Requirements

For the basic Python files (01-12), no external libraries are needed - just Python 3.

For data science and ML files (13-25), you'll need:
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
- Pandas (`pip install pandas`)
- scikit-learn (`pip install scikit-learn`)

## Learning Philosophy

- **Simple and readable**: Code is kept simple to focus on understanding concepts
- **One concept per file**: Each file teaches one main idea
- **Progressive complexity**: Building from basics to more advanced topics
- **Learning-focused comments**: Comments reflect the learning process

## My Journey

This collection shows my progression from:
- Basic Python syntax and data structures
- Understanding how to work with data using NumPy and Pandas
- Learning machine learning concepts
- Building and evaluating my first predictive model

Each file represents a step in my learning journey, from writing my first "Hello, World!" to successfully training a machine learning model that can predict house prices.
